# Hello, I'm Dan

Welcome to My Portfolio! 👋

I'm a passionate **public policy advisor** in the UK with a desire to make policy more data-led. To do this, I'm fixing myself first, developing my skills in data science and cybersecurity. This space is where I showcase my projects, skills, and achievements.
